Agglomerative-music-data-cluster
================================
To organize the music data in easy retrival manner,the concept of agglomerative co-clustering is using in this project.

Agglomerative cluster:
        1)Agglomerative cluster is one of the methods of Hierarchical clustering.
        2)This is a "bottom up" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.
        3)It is more efficient than that of the divisive clustring method.

Note: For clustering of music data using agglomerative co-clustering method the souce code is enclosed.The Language used is Java Server Pages(jsp).
